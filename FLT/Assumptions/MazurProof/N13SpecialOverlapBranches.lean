Source pin: 887d29cd9eb9b60a6e5ec438ff919a74ccda41e5.
Uncompiled B03 source candidate; all Lean and axiom checks NOT RUN.

The actual special ordinary overlap maps to each Laurent branch. The maps
agree with the just-constructed affine expansions and with the inclusions
of the actual infinity power-series expansions. Consequently a special
comparison transports one and the same fraction to both branches.
