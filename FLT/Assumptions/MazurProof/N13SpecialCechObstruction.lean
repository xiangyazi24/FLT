# The special-fibre Čech obstruction at the N13 base divisor

Put `t = 1/x` and `v = y/x³` on the infinity chart.  For the structure
sheaf, the two classes missing from the affine and infinity chart images
are represented by

`v t⁻², v t⁻¹`.

The two simple principal parts at `(0,0)` and `(1,0)` map to `(1,0)` and
`(1,1)` in this obstruction basis.  The resulting triangular matrix has
determinant one.  This is the explicit special-fibre Čech form of the
nonspeciality of the divisor `(0,0)+(1,0)`.

The polynomial identities below are the cleared-denominator transition
calculation.  They use the actual infinity-chart coefficient
`1+t²+t³`; no point enumeration or certificate table is involved.
