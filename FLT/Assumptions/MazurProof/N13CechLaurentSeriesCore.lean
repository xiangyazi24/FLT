# The formal Laurent-series Čech core

The proper two-chart calculation at infinity uses Laurent series, not only
Laurent polynomials: a function such as `1 / (1 + t)` is regular at
`t = 0`, but has an infinite power-series tail.

Write a formal overlap function in the basis `1,v` as `a(t) + b(t)v`.
The affine chart contributes scalar exponents at most zero and
`v`-exponents at most `-3`; the formal infinity chart contributes
nonnegative exponents.  Their additive Čech quotient is therefore still
represented exactly by

`b₋₂, b₋₁`.

Unlike the finite Laurent-polynomial model, this file includes every
power-series tail and hence gives the correct formal neighbourhood used by
the proper lifting argument.
