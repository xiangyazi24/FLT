# Saturated affine ideals on the special N13 overlap

The special affine and infinity charts meet on the principal open where
`x` is invertible.  If `x` is already a unit modulo an affine ideal, then
localizing at `x` loses no information: the original ideal is the contraction
of its extension to the overlap.

This gives a useful uniqueness principle for special divisors.  Two compatible
chart pairs with the same infinity ideal and `x`-saturated affine ideals have
the same affine ideal, so the infinity calculation alone determines the whole
pair.
