# The special N13 infinity chart is integral

Over `F₂`, the infinity chart is

`v² + (1+t²+t³)v = t+t²`.

Irreducibility follows from a degree gap.  A factorization of the monic
quadratic would give polynomials `a,b` with `a*b = t+t²` and
`a+b = 1+t²+t³`.  The product forces both factors to have degree at most
two, whereas their sum has degree three.

No polynomial enumeration or coefficient table is used.
