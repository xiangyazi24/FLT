# The actual formal overlap algebra for the N13 integral curve

The pair multiplication used by the formal Čech calculation is not an
abstract two-dimensional algebra.  It is the normal-form multiplication in
the quadratic algebra

`R₂((t))[v] / (v² + (1+t²+t³)v - (t+t²))`.

This file identifies the two descriptions and constructs the restriction
homomorphism from the actual affine coordinate ring by

`x ↦ t⁻¹`, `y ↦ t⁻³v`.

Thus a unit obtained from a genuine local trivialization gives, without any
extra inverse hypothesis, the `NearIdentityTransition` consumed by the
Čech--Nakayama theorem.
