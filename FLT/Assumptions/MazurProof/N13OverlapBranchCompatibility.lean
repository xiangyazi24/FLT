Source pin: 887d29cd9eb9b60a6e5ec438ff919a74ccda41e5.
Uncompiled source candidate; all Lean and axiom checks NOT RUN.

The actual ordinary overlap has two faithful rational Laurent branch maps.
Their affine restrictions are the named function-field expansions; their
infinity restrictions are the inclusions of the named power-series maps.
Thus the primitive chart transport gives the SAME fraction on BOTH branches.
