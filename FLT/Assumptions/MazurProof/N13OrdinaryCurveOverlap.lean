# The ordinary algebraic overlap of the two N13 charts

This file begins the ordinary, pre-completion two-chart model.  It localizes
the infinity chart at `t` and constructs the affine restriction by

`x ↦ t⁻¹`, `y ↦ t⁻³v`.

The construction uses the universal properties of `AdjoinRoot` and
`Localization.Away`; its equation check is the presentation-independent
identity in `N13OrdinaryOverlapCore`.
