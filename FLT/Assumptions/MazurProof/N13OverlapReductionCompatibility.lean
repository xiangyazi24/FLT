# Reduction commutes with the N13 two-chart overlap

The ordinary affine and infinity reductions extend to their distinguished
principal opens.  The two resulting squares commute with the ordinary and
special overlap equivalences.

Everything is proved from localization and `AdjoinRoot` universal
properties.  No pointwise calculation on either special chart is used.
