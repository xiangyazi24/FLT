# Semantic characteristic-three counts for the level-25 quotient

The executable counts over `F3`, `F9`, and `F27` use explicit polynomial-basis
tables.  This file identifies those tables with the actual field equations and
proves that the linear-elimination count is the cardinality of the normalized
canonical curve.

The central equivalence follows the projective chart decomposition.  On the
regular `x`-chart, the quadric determines `w` uniquely and the cubic becomes
the bivariate residual.  The exceptional divisor `z=1` and the three boundary
charts are retained literally.  Thus no ambient four-coordinate enumeration
enters the semantic comparison.
