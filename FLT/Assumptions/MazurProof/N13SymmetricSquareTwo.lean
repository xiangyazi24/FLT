# The symmetric-square route to `#J(F₂)=19`

For a genus-two curve, the Abel map `Sym²(C) → J` is an isomorphism away
from the canonical divisor class.  Its exceptional fibre is the canonical
linear system `P¹`.  Over `F₂` this replaces three points by one.

The good N13 model has six `F₂`-points, so its ordinary symmetric square has
`6 multichoose 2 = 21` points.  This file proves the finite fibre-counting
argument that turns the geometric Abel-fibre statement into
`#J(F₂)=21-2=19`.  It deliberately isolates the remaining geometric input
as a structure, rather than assuming a general zeta-function API or
enumerating Jacobian representatives.
