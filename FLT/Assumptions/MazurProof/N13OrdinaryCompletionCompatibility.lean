# Compatibility of the ordinary and formal N13 overlaps

The ordinary infinity overlap is obtained by inverting `t`.  Composing the
ordinary infinity chart with its completion and the formal restriction sends
`t` to a Laurent unit, so the universal property of `Localization.Away`
gives a canonical map to the formal overlap.

This file proves that the resulting map agrees with both ordinary chart
restrictions.  No flatness, injectivity of completion, or algebraization
theorem is used.
