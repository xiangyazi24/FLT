# The two-chart Laurent Čech core

For a generalized hyperelliptic equation of degree six, write an overlap
function in the infinity coordinates as `a(t) + b(t)v`.  The affine chart
contributes scalar Laurent exponents at most zero and `v`-exponents at most
`-3`; the infinity chart contributes nonnegative exponents.  Their additive
Čech quotient is therefore represented exactly by the two coefficients

`b₋₂, b₋₁`.

This calculation is valid over every commutative coefficient ring.  Keeping
it ring-generic lets the N13 special fibre and its integral two-adic lift use
the same decomposition theorem.
