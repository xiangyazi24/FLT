# Coordinate identities on the ordinary N13 overlap

The two algebraic charts are related on their principal opens by

`x = t⁻¹`, `y = t⁻³v`.

This file proves both directions of the coordinate change over an arbitrary
commutative ring.  No cancellation or domain hypothesis is used: the only
input is the explicit inverse relation on the principal open.
