# Infinity closure of finite affine N13 point lines

For an integral affine point `(a,b)`, the same section on the infinity chart
is cut out by the weighted equations

`1 - a t = 0` and `v - b t³ = 0`.

The first equation makes `t` invertible modulo the weighted ideal, with
inverse `a`.  Hence the ideal is already saturated with respect to `t`;
contracting its extension from the overlap introduces no extra component.
This identifies the abstract `infinityClosure` with the explicit weighted
point ideal and makes its special reduction computable.
