# Proper two-chart closure of a finite N13 affine divisor

An invertible ideal on the affine chart need not by itself record its
behaviour at infinity.  For an ideal with finite support over the two-adic
coefficient ring, however, the affine coordinate is integral in the
quotient.  A monic equation for that coordinate reflects to an equation with
constant coefficient one on the infinity chart.  Hence the infinity
uniformizer is a unit modulo the contracted overlap ideal.

The principal-localization patching theorem then upgrades invertibility on
the punctured infinity chart to invertibility on the full infinity chart.
This supplies proper extensions for finite N13 graph ideals, including
integral affine points and the finite irreducible quadratic branch, without
choosing reciprocal coordinates.
