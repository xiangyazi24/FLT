# Two-chart closure of a vertical N13 infinity graph

A recovered vertical graph has infinity ideal

`(m(v), t - (a + c v))`.

After the substitutions `t=x⁻¹` and `v=x⁻³y`, clearing weights gives the
affine generators `x⁶m(x⁻³y)` and
`x³(t-a-cv) = x²-a x³-cy`.  The direct reciprocal kernel also contains a
monic quadratic equation in `t`; its weighted reflection has constant
coefficient one.  Adding this third, redundant overlap generator keeps the
affine support inside `D(x)`.

The infinity ideal is invertible on `D(x)`.  The principal-localization
patching theorem then proves that the three-generated affine closure is
invertible globally.
