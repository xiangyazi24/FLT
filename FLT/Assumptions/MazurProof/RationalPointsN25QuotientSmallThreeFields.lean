# The small executable ternary extensions as actual fields

The characteristic-three point counts over `F3`, `F9`, and `F27` were
originally phrased using polynomial-basis operation tables.  This file equips
those same types with genuine field structures and proves that the table
operations are their field operations.

The proof is structural.  All additive, multiplicative, associative, and
distributive laws reduce to polynomial identities over the already certified
prime field `Trit`.  Finite computation is used only for the terminal inverse
laws on the 8 and 26 nonzero elements of the two extension fields.
