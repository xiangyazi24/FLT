# Special classes of integral affine N13 point lines

An integral point on the good two-adic affine chart has a literal monic graph
ideal and, by finite-support closure, an honest proper two-chart line.
Coefficientwise reduction sends that affine ideal exactly to the linear graph
of the reduced point on the special curve.

The special Abel model has degree two, so a reduced affine point is normalized
by adjoining the fixed positive-infinity anchor once.  This normalization is
kept explicit: the affine ideal alone cannot see it because the positive
infinity point line is trivial on the affine chart.
