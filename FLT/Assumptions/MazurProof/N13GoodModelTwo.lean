# A good characteristic-two model of `X₁(13)`

The completed-square sextic is not the model to reduce modulo two.  This file
uses the generalized hyperelliptic equation

`y² + (x³+x+1)y = x⁵+x⁴`.

Over the rationals, completing the square gives the existing N13 sextic.
In characteristic two, the affine chart and the chart at infinity both have
nonzero derivative in the second coordinate.  The `F₂`- and `F₄`-point
counts are obtained from Frobenius and the Artin--Schreier map, not by
enumerating field elements.
