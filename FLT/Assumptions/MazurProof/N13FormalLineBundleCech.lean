# Near-trivial formal line bundles in the N13 Čech chart

A line bundle in the kernel of specialization admits, after choosing local
trivializations, a formal overlap transition which reduces to `1`.  Twisting
the two actual principal parts by such a transition perturbs the integral
connecting matrix, but does not change its special fibre.

This file encodes the actual quadratic formal curve algebra at infinity,
proves coefficientwise reduction respects its multiplication, and applies
the previously proved Čech--Nakayama theorem to every invertible transition
reducing to `1`.

The remaining geometric task is now sharply isolated: construct these two
local trivializations from a rational Picard class in the specialization
kernel.  No cohomology or matrix-surjectivity hypothesis remains.
