# Canonical special-chart ideals of degree-two divisors

The completed special N13 curve is covered by its ordinary affine chart and
its infinity chart.  A finite point with horizontal coordinate zero is absent
from the overlap, a finite point with horizontal coordinate one lies on both
charts, and an infinity point is absent from the ordinary affine chart.

This file assigns to every completed point its compatible pair of chart
ideals.  Products of two point pairs then descend through the symmetric square
to give canonical chart ideals for every effective divisor of degree two.
