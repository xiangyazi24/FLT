Source pin: 887d29cd9eb9b60a6e5ec438ff919a74ccda41e5.
Uncompiled B03 source candidate; all Lean and axiom checks NOT RUN.

Each named special branch is faithful on the ordinary coordinate ring.
The norm proves affine faithfulness; localization and the actual overlap
diagram transfer it to the infinity chart. No faithfulness of completion
is postulated.
