# The actual formal principal parts in the integral N13 Čech complex

The second N13 base point produces a regular tail containing
`1 / (1 + t)`.  This is why the proper/formal overlap must use Laurent
series rather than Laurent polynomials.

This file writes both integral principal parts as genuine formal Laurent
series, proves their cleared-denominator identities, and identifies their
classes with the finite connecting matrix already used by the
Čech--Nakayama argument.
