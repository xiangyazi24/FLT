# The actual formal infinity chart of the N13 integral curve

The additive Čech calculation described the infinity-chart image as pairs of
power series.  This file realizes that submodule as the image of the actual
quadratic formal curve

`ℤ₂[[t]][v] / (v² + (1+t²+t³)v - (t+t²))`

inside the punctured formal overlap.  In particular, the previously defined
`infinitySections` is neither an approximation nor a coefficientwise
superset: it is exactly the restriction image of the genuine chart ring.
