Source pin: 887d29cd9eb9b60a6e5ec438ff919a74ccda41e5.
Uncompiled source candidate; all Lean and axiom checks NOT RUN.

Transport an affine numerator and denominator with nonzero reductions to
the ordinary infinity chart without losing their reductions. Both chart
fractions are proved equal by an exact overlap cross-product equation.
No equality of line ideals is assumed or claimed in this transport lemma.
